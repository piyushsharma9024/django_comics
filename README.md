# django_comics
Here is how we will make this project work i will explain step by step:
1. first you need to clone this repository in your visual studio code or any IDE you use then open the project. 
2. open terminal go in the project base and run this command "python -m venv env" and then activate the virtual environment by typing "env/Scripts/activate".
3. download all the requirments for the application 
      (Django==3.1.4, Pillow, taggit).
4. After downloading all packages run command "python manage.py migrate". After its done run command "python manage.py createsuperuser" and then go and add your comics and all in app as you want.
5. You have to create a Folder with name "media" in the base directory (Very important) to make this project work.
6. Also i am using Fancybox to show images you can visit fancybox.com to find more details about it.
7. And that is pretty much all you need to make this App work. Thanks!
